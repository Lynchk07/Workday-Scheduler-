# Workday-Scheduler-GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
This is a simple workday scheduling app. It uses css,html,and javascript. Javascript local storage is used to store the entry data. When the page is refreshed or when the page reloads task data is still available for the user. There is also an edit button that is available for editing and saving hourly tasks.
